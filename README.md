# Katakest

Katakest is an application that assists in memorizing Japanese characters, specifically Hiragana and Katakana. It provides a basic, interactive way to practice recognizing and recalling the characters.

# Motivation

Learning Japanese characters can be challenging, especially for beginners. Katakest aims to make the process more engaging and effective by providing a simple, interactive tool for practice. By offering immediate feedback and progress tracking, users can focus on kanas that need more practice and gradually improve their memorization skills.

I started this project as an excuse to practice TypeScript and explore some of the latest technologies in its ecosystem. Since I work as a Java developer, I want to keep my skills sharp in more flexible languages. Plus, it's a fun way to dust off my GitHub üï∏Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏è.

## Features

- Random selection of characters for practice.
- Immediate feedback on answers.
- Progress tracking.
- User-friendly interface.

## Technologies

- [Solid.js](https://solidjs.com/): A declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast build tool that provides instant server start and hot module replacement.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): A fast, disk-space-efficient package manager.

## Code Structure

The main components of the application are:

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";
import "./index.css";
import MainScreen from "@components/MainScreen";
import ResultsScreen from "@components/ResultsScreen";
import { GameProvider } from "@context/GameContext";

const root = document.getElementById("root");

function App() {
  return (
    <GameProvider>
      <Router>
        <Route path="/" component={MainScreen} />
        <Route path="/results" component={ResultsScreen} />
      </Router>
    </GameProvider>
  );
}

render(() => <App />, root!);
```
